## Future of Chum:

### Alarms:
We're currently working on integrating an alarm reminder system so that Chum can better help keep you accountable! The idea is to set alarms automatically on your phone to remind you in advance what you need to do and when. Keep on the lookout for the next update!

### Personalized Settings:
We want to provide a more personal experience than what Chum is currently offering. Expect to be able to adjust your own personal settings to the look, organization, and filter of Chum!

### Chums:
Chum is also soon looking to expand to Chums! Chum originally is an individual app looking to aid one person in organizing their tasks, however, Chums is looking to help groups of people plan and design their tasks as a group! More details will come soon!
